            The institution was set up at historic Kashmere Gate campus as a
            follow up of the Wood and Abott Committee of 1938. The Institute
            came into existence in the year 1941 to cater the needs of Indian
            industries for trained technical manpower with practical experience
            and sound theoretical knowledge. The national diploma awarded by the
            institution was recognized as equivalent to degree level for the
            purposes of employment. In 1952 the college was affiliated with
            University of Delhi and called as Delhi College of Engineering.

            The department of Architecture later became the School of Planning
            and Architecture, now a Deemed University and Institution of
            National importance. The department of Arts and Sculpture became
            College of Arts and the departments of Chemical Technology and
            Textile Technology were shifted out to mark beginning of the IIT
            Delhi. The erstwhile DCE functioned from its historic Kashmere Gate
            Campus for almost 55 years and has shifted in 1996 to its lush green
            sprawling campus of 164 Acres at Bawana Road, adjoining Sector-17,
            Rohini, Delhi-42.
