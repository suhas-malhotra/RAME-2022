                    The institution was set up at historic Kashmere Gate campus
                    as a follow up of the Wood and Abott Committee of 1938. The
                    Institute came into existence in the year 1941 to cater the
                    needs of Indian industries for trained technical manpower
                    with practical experience and sound theoretical knowledge.
                    The national diploma awarded by the institution was
                    recognized as equivalent to degree level for the purposes of
                    employment. In 1952 the college was affiliated with
                    University of Delhi and called as Delhi College of
                    Engineering. The department of Architecture later became the
                    School of Planning and Architecture, now a Deemed University
                    and Institution of National importance. The department of
                    Arts and Sculpture became College of Arts and the
                    departments of Chemical Technology and Textile Technology
                    were shifted out en-block to mark beginning of the IIT
                    Delhi. The erstwhile DCE functioned from its historic
                    Kashmere Gate Campus for almost 55 years and has shifted in
                    1996 to its lush green sprawling campus of 164 Acres at
                    Bawana Road, adjoining Sector-17, Rohini, Delhi-42. Its
                    shifting to new campus has added the dimension of research
                    and caused innovations in plenty, which has received high
                    national and international acclaim. .{" "}

                    The Department of Mechanical Engineering, Automobile
                    Engineering and Production & Industrial Engineering has seen
                    considerable growth since its inception in 1941. The
                    department offers UG programme in Mechanical, Production &
                    Industrial Engineering and Automobile Engineering and PG
                    programmes on Thermal Engineering, Production Engineering,
                    Renewable Energy Technology and Computational Design. About
                    200 research Scholars are presently pursuing their Ph.D.
                    research work. The department possesses modern laboratories
                    equipped with latest experimental set-ups, and research
                    facilities for instrumentation, experimental stress
                    analysis, strength of materials, fluid mechanics, IC
                    engines, Automotive Engineering, Robotics, Heat Transfer,
                    Solar Energy, Flexible Manufacturing System, Computational
                    Fluid Dynamics supported by Software like View-Flex,
                    CAD-CAM, etc. The Department has small to medium capacity
                    state of art bio-diesel processing units. Different species
                    of non-edible oil such as linseed, Thumba, Jatropha,
                    cottonseed, waste cooking oil etc. and high FFA oils such as
                    rice bran, Neem, Mahua etc. have been successfully converted
                    into bio diesel. We are on the way to make DTU campus a zero
                    organic waste campus. Special projects are in progress rto
                    manage e-waste in DTU campus.DTU has achieved zero liquid
                    discharge successfully with the installation of STTP plant.
